# Do Maternal Chronic Health Conditions Affect Pregnancy Outcomes?

This project uses probabilistic modeling and statistical hypothesis testing to investigate whether pre-existing chronic conditions — specifically hypertension and diabetes — impact pregnancy and birth outcomes, such as gestational duration (preterm vs. full-term), delivery method (vaginal vs. cesarean), and neonatal health indicators (birth weight, APGAR scores, NICU admission). This addresses a clinically significant question with clear public health implications.

## Statistical Analyses Ideas
- Two-sample t-tests (for comparing mean values of two groups to see if difference is significant)
  - Ideas:
    - Compare average gestational age between mothers with vs. without hypertension
    - Compare mean birth weights between diabetic vs. non-diabetic mothers
- Chi-square Test for independence (if 2 variables are categorical associated or independent)
  - Ideas:
    - Test if delivery type (vaginal/cesarean) is independent of diabetes status
    - Test association between having chronic condition and preterm birth (yes/no)
- Monte Carlo Simulation 
  - Generate predicted distributions of birth weights given maternal health conditions
  - Simulate pregnancy outcomes under different chronic condition prevalence scenarios

## Statistical Method Requirements (from course website)

  <summary>Requirements (click to expand)</summary>

  - Hypothesis Testing (use each at least once or twice):
    - t-tests
    - Chi-square tests
    - Bootstrap methods
    - ANOVA
    - If any assumption is violated (e.g., normality, equal variances), choose the appropriate non-parametric alternative. Make sure to do the relevant tests to see if these assumptions violates.
 
- Time Series Analysis:
    - You must analyze at least two time-varying variables.
    - Use appropriate time-series modeling techniques (e.g., ARIMA, TS EDA).
    - Model Diagnostics
